"""Engine test: an IN-PROGRESS queued item must never read as finished/done (the OAD bug).

Live-Plex evidence (2026-08, kevin_anime): the entry "Prison School: Mad Wax (2016)" is a
1-leaf, Season-0 OAD (ratingKey 363480 -> leaf 363482), and Plex has it mid-episode
(viewOffset 1060898 ms, viewCount ABSENT = 0, no history row). An earlier scan still marked
the entry `done: true`, because `_keep_episode` dropped its only leaf as a front-loading
"special", so it looked finished — and it was then skipped while the owner was mid-episode.

This exercises the REAL resolve_member / next_queue (only the Plex network layer + the
queues.yaml writers are stubbed) and asserts:
  * a specials-only show keeps its Season-0 leaf on the queue path (not dropped);
  * an in-progress leaf is kept even when the set's history counts it watched;
  * an entry flagged `done: true` but actually in-progress is REVIVED (selected, resumed at
    its viewOffset) and its stale flag cleared;
  * a genuinely-watched item (viewCount >= 1) still resolves finished / stays done.

Run:  python3 e2e/resume-in-progress-done-test.py   (from the repo root; non-zero on failure)
